## James didn't watch Clone Wars

Speaker 0: 00:00:00

Yeah.

Speaker 1: 00:00:03

You are gonna believe this, but there's been some tech news recently. Don't worry. We plan for this. It's just like the simulations. This is a simulation.

## Google layoffs, ChatGPT fears

Google seems to have a monster under its bed named chat Gp.

Speaker 2: 00:00:16

The recent launch of the popular

Speaker 1: 00:00:17

Ai chatbot has set off alarms at Google causing the company to call in its dads for help. Larry Page and Sergey Brand, the founders of Google and controlling shareholders of the parent company alphabet have come back to the company after having left their daily roles back in twenty nineteen, also known as the before times. To do whatever men under fifty with unlimited money can do, which is literally anything.

Speaker 2: 00:00:39

Or

Speaker 1: 00:00:41

or podcasting.

Speaker 0: 00:00:42

Lasso of the move.

Speaker 2: 00:00:43

The pair were invited by currency Ceo,

Speaker 1: 00:00:45

Thunder Pic chai last month to offer advice and pitch ideas. Google plans to launch over twenty Ai products by the end of the year, including a demo version of its search engine with chatbot features. And there's Shampoo for artificial intelligence. This is very exciting news for the company's Ai division and everyone bought the twelve thousand people in other departments who are being laid off by Google due allegedly to economic downturn. It's robots. The company is also facing several antitrust lawsuits, which is the opposite set of trust from Epic and match Llc, as well as the Us departments of justice. Just actually just one department, The justice one. All this pressure could end up hurting Google bad, especially if bing can implement chatbot features first and someone notices it. Duck dot Go has when It just says turn off your computer.

Speaker 0: 00:01:34

Have you noticed bing is different? What?

## Twitter bans third-party clients

Speaker 2: 00:01:36

Twitter has officially banned third party clients.

Speaker 1: 00:01:39

But why should we care about third. Bronze is a sub par metal that went out of style three thousand years ago. And yes, While that is completely true. Twitter may have not been super upfront about how or why they were doing this. The official Twitter dev account that the platform was enforcing its long standing Api rules. And then neglected to you know, name a rule. Then yesterday and Gadget noticed that Twitter had added a clause to the developer agreement that banned the ability to use or access the license materials to create or attempt to create a substitute or similar service or product to the Twitter applications. The company that made Twitter r, the third party client that actually coined the term tweet released a blog post saying that the social platform has become Twitter that we no longer recognized as trustworthy or worth coming up with fun c for.

Speaker 2: 00:02:31

That's not part of the quota. In a fun coincidence, that same Twitter

Speaker 1: 00:02:35

now owned by Elon Musk, also known as Buffalo Bill Dodge is being sued for refusing to pay the consulting firm that has assisted in the lawsuit, the company launched against Musk when he tried to tobacco a buy. That is amazing. I tried I tried to coming up with an analogy for the situation, but it's just too wacky.

Speaker 2: 00:02:52

The situation is the joke itself. It funnels analog.

## MSI motherboards Secure Boot issue

Speaker 1: 00:02:58

And the secure boot feature on at least three hundred Msi motherboard is not working as intended depending on who's doing the intending. For the uni. I almost said unintended. Secure boot is a feature in motherboard firmware that ensures Pc only boot software that is trusted by the motherboard manufacturer. However, security researcher, David Pot, discovered hundreds

Speaker 2: 00:03:20

of Msi motherboard would let just any old software boot. In

Speaker 1: 00:03:24

by words have no standard these days, but don't worry. Msi has responded to the findings and according to them, It's working flawlessly. The manufacturer said they added a second setting called image execution policy that is set to always execute software by default even though secure boot is enabled. They said the default always execute setting is to offer a user friendly environment, which makes perfect fix sense, think of how user friendly would be to not have a front door. You

Speaker 2: 00:03:51

could just walk right into

Speaker 1: 00:03:52

your house and not have to lock any thing when you leave. And when you're really mad,

Speaker 2: 00:03:57

no one knows. And your counter are super clean because everyone's stole your stuff.

Speaker 0: 00:04:00

You

Speaker 1: 00:04:00

got nothing to apologize for.

Speaker 0: 00:04:02

Minimalist a living.

Speaker 1: 00:04:03

According to W cc tech, this behavior may not be isolated to Msi. They claim that Asus and gigabyte boards may also have issues with securing their boot. Guess no one knows how to tie their shoes anymore. Might as well be slip ons. That never made it in frame, but I almost hit the camera. Now, I'm taller on one side. Oh. Fails all around when nerves try to throw.

Speaker 0: 00:04:25

Now it's

## T-Mobile data breach

Us Mobile writer T Mobile has admitted they were hacked. Well, they admitted some of it to some people. In a press

Speaker 2: 00:05:32

release, the company stated the breach was shut down within twenty four hours of being detected.

Speaker 1: 00:05:37

What they didn't mention there, but they did mention in an Sec filing was that the data of thirty seven million cost was hacked and that the breach wasn't detected for over a month. But once they detected it.

Speaker 2: 00:05:49

Now you have reason to switch

Speaker 1: 00:05:50

to At and T that doesn't involve an unhealthy obsession with the women from their ads.

Speaker 2: 00:05:54

Leave Lilly alone guys.

Speaker 1: 00:05:55

It's worth getting a Vpn in

## KFC, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut ransomware attack

Canada four. Speaking of Sec filings, yum brands, the parent company of Kfc, Taco bell and other toilet rumors. I admitted they also had data stolen. They suffered an attack from a ransom wear gang so bad over three hundred locations in the Uk were forced to shut down. Thankfully, all locations are back up and running. So you can panic fried chicken as you wait for something to hack you. It's their food. It's like popping a balloon in the toilet bowl. It's so bad.

Speaker 0: 00:06:26

Really that hackers were doing is a favor.

## RX 6000 GPUs killed by washing?

Speaker 2: 00:06:28

Chris fix, a drone repair service that was sent forty eight

Speaker 1: 00:06:31

Rad Rx six thousand cards with crack Gpus in a matter of weeks, thinks they may have figured out just what happened. After determining, most of the cards were bought second hand. The repair shop posted a video explaining that they believe the cards were sold by crypto miners and somehow water got trapped under the chip and that expanded when the card got hot. Chris fix thinks they were stored in a human environment while Reddit thinks, they were hose down by miners before sale like in that viral lip.

Speaker 3: 00:07:00

Some Vietnamese miners have cleaned up their old graphics cards after Ethereum merged by bathing gum with extremely high risk.

Speaker 1: 00:07:07

Ask yourself what's more important. A clean card or a card that doesn't explode. That's a tough one.

Speaker 2: 00:07:13

It's like free fire.

Speaker 0: 00:07:14

Gotta keep them clean.

Speaker 2: 00:07:16

Explosions though.

Speaker 1: 00:07:17

Back on the menu baby.

Speaker 2: 00:07:33

Mod has promised to replace the product.

Speaker 1: 00:07:36

Humble swore that he inserted the cable into the Apu properly and that he had been using it for two months or you know, someone's lying on reddit, But that's that's crazy. They would get downloaded

Speaker 2: 00:07:48

as a six year old girl. I can tell you Red is honest.

Speaker 1: 00:07:51

Sixteen f

## Wizards of the Coast apologizes

Tally. And wizards of the coast have finally apologized for trying to release a new worst version of the current open gaming license, which allows creators to make publish content for the Dungeons and Dragon's Rpg. Just after a path finder publisher or peso announced fifteen hundred companies have pledged their support for the Og alternative. The Open Rpg creative license o or or c. Orc

Speaker 2: 00:08:16

Dude. Org. We're calling it Orc. Wizard of the coast said that they would no longer d authorize their earlier version

Speaker 1: 00:08:23

of the open gaming license. Except that they still are just not for content already published under the earlier version. I guess that's a half lie, which is only half as bad as their last statement. So at least they're improving. Half elf, half orc, half lane. Half ling. They love half Demi go. Demi me moore.
