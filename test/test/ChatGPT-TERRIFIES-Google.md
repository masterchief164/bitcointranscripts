## James didn't watch Clone Wars

 Yeah! How come? How come? You aren't going to believe this, but there's been some tech news recently. Don't worry, we plan for this. It's just like the simulations. This is a simulation.

## Google layoffs, ChatGPT fears

 Google seems to have a monster under its bed named ChatGPT. The recent launch of the popular AI chatbot has set off alarms at Google causing the company to call in its dads for help. Larry Page and Sergey Brand, the founders of Google and controlling shareholders of the parent company, Elphabet, have come back to the company after having left their daily rules back in 2019, also known as the Before Times. To do whatever men under 50, with unlimited money can do, which is literally anything. Or podcasting. The pair were invited by current CEO Sundar P. Chai last month to offer advice and pitch ideas. Google plans to launch over 20 AI products by the end of the year, including a demo version of its search engine with chatbot features. And this is a shampoo for artificial intelligence. This is very exciting news for the company's AI division, and everyone but the 12,000 people in other departments who are being laid off by Google do a ledgerly to economic downturn. It's robots. The company is also facing several anti-trust lawsuits, which is the opposite of trust from Epic and Match LLC, as well as the U.S. departments of justice. Just actually just one department, the justice one. All this pressure could end up hurting Google bad, especially if Bing can implement chatbot features first, and someone notices. Duck Duck Gohaz when it just says, Turn off your computer. Have you noticed Bing is different? What is this?

## Twitter bans third-party clients

 Twitter has officially banned third-party clients, but why should we care about third? Bronze is a subpar medal that went out of style 3,000 years ago, and yet, while that is completely true, Twitter may have not been super upfront about how or why they were doing this. The official Twitter dev account said that the platform was enforcing its long-standing API rules, and then neglected to, you know, name a rule. Then, yesterday, and Gadget noticed that Twitter had added a clause to the developer agreement that banned the ability to use or access the license materials to create or attempt to create a substitute or similar service or product to the Twitter applications. The company that made Twitter afic, the third-party client that actually coined the term tweet, released a blog post saying that the social platform has become a Twitter that we no longer recognize as trustworthy, or worth coming up with fun colloquialisms for. That's up or the quote. In a fun coincidence, that same Twitter, now owned by Elon Musk, also known as Buffalo Bill Dodger, is being sued for refusing to pay the consulting firm that assisted in the lawsuit the company launched against Musk when he tried to back it up by it. That is amazing. I tried to come up with a analogy for this situation, but it's just too wacky. The situation is the joke itself. The book of Fuddles Analogies.

## MSI motherboards Secure Boot issue

 And the secure boot feature on at least 300 MSI motherboards is not working as intended, depending on who's doing the intending. For the uninitiated, I almost said unintended. Secure boot is a feature in motherboard firmware that ensures PC's only boot software that is trusted by the motherboard manufacturer. However, security researcher David Puttaki discovered hundreds of MSI motherboards would let just any old software boot. Motherboards have no standard of these days, but don't worry, MSI has responded to the findings, and according to them, it's working flawlessly. The manufacturer said they added a second setting called Image Execution Policy. That is, set to always execute software by default, even though secure boot is enabled. They said the default AlwaysExCute setting is to offer a user-friendly environment, which makes perfect sense. Think of how user-friendly it would be to not have a front door. You could just walk right into your house and not have to lock anything when you leave it, when you're really mad. No one knows. And your counters are super clean because they want to slow your stuff. You got nothing to apologize for. Man, hello. According to WCCF tech, this behavior may not be isolated to MSI. They claim that ASUS and Gigabyte boards may also have issues with securing their boot. I guess no one knows how to tie their shoes anymore. Mine as well be slip-ons! That never made it in frame, but I almost hit the camera. Now I'm taller on one side. Oh! Feels all around when nerds try to throw.

## T-Mobile data breach

 US mobile provider T-Mobile has admitted they were hacked. Well, they admitted some of it to some people. In a press release, the company stated the breach was shut down within 24 hours of being detected. What they didn't mention there, but they did mention an SEC filing was that the data of 37 million customers was hacked and that the breach wasn't detected for over a month. But once it detected it, now you have reason to switch to AT&T that doesn't involve an unhealthy obsession with the women from their ads.

## RX 6000 GPUs killed by washing?

 Chris Fix, a drone repair service that was sent 48 radion RX 6000 cars with crack GPUs and a matter of weeks, thinks they may have figured out just what happened. After determining, most of the cars were bought second-hand. The repair shop posted a video explaining that they believed the cars were sold by crypto miners and somehow water got trapped under the chip and that expanded when the car got hot. Chris Fix thinks they were stored in a human environment while reddit thinks they were hoes down by miners before sale like in that viral clip. Some Vietnamese miners have cleaned up their old graphics cards after Ethereum merged by bathing them with extremely high risk. You gotta ask yourself what's more important, a clean card or a card that doesn't explode. That's a tough one. It's like free farmers. Gotta keep you clean. Sponsions though. That's how the menu baby.
