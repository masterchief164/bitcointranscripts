It's all really wild. And it's it's interesting. Right? Because it's emerging and people are wondering whether or not this is ever going to be a legitimate. But if you're right, and if the spec are right, that it's all gonna fall apart, that's interesting too to see what

Speaker 1: 0:0:13

what happens that look crypto industry may imp eventually.

Speaker 0: 0:0:17

Yeah.

Speaker 1: 0:0:18

Yeah. I mean, like I said, I'm no expert on. But guy named matt's. He basically says like, the whole thing is bogus. Like, everything is like f x sand freed. Like it's all it's tall garbage.

Speaker 2: 0:0:27

Well, the crypto industry collapsed, Joe Rogan and Kyle Ka discussed that on Joe Rogan podcast. And Kyle Ka stated that he's not an expert when it comes to crypto, and I definitely believe him. But although I disagree with most of what Ka k had to say there are things I agree with. He stated F x is Bogus. And that's true. F t x is not crypto. F x is a web two company in crypto clothing. This goes for all crypto exchanges. It's not actually crypto. They are no different then bang. So when it comes to crypto though, I believe crypto is not a scam. However, majority of crypto is a scam, and the same goes for N t's, I believe T's are not a scam, but majority of entities are a scam. And when it comes to crypto and n entities, does anyone even use it?

Speaker 0: 0:1:21

Why does it even have value? Well, if people agree that it's money, that's the thing. Right? If people agree that crypto money and they use it and exchange it and

Speaker 1: 0:1:30

buy things and it becomes established. One of the problems is, it's it's a very tiny percentage of it that's actually used as currency. It's like less than ten percent. Bitcoin for example, which is like the most established one, people don't actually use it as currency for the most part. It's it's a speculative investment. And then now you have interest

Speaker 0: 0:1:48

rates going up, that's affecting everything that's speculative and everything they're all going belly up. But the idea behind it, people want decentralized currency that's not controlled by the government. And so this is the the reason why they created it in the first place and the idea behind it is that, you know, we could put it in this decentralized form where we all agree that this is money and it's not being influenced by anyone else and you can exchange it. And with with bitcoin, there's a limited amount of it. Right? So there's a benefit in that. That you really can't like, raise it and can you can't make more of it

Speaker 2: 0:2:20

when it comes to people actually using Bitcoin or Crypto though as a currency, I agree with their statements. Most people don't use it for that purpose. Most people use it. For speculation. Of course, it's a brand new emerging industry. So we can expect at this moment for everyone to use it as a currency. However, there are people in this world that need Bitcoin. I'm talking about light saving situations. And if anyone ever questions the use case of Bi Bitcoin a crypto just show them this article. Young Ukrainian escapes war with Us holding forty percent of his life savings in crypto. And asset such as Bitcoin are very valuable, Two people that experience high inflation, for example, countries such as Venezuela, sudan zimbabwe and Yemen. And of course, we just use some of the more extreme examples. But what about for people like you or me most of the people that watch my videos live in the United states. I myself on the Us citizen. I don't actually need to use crypto for payments. However, I still do because it's a lot more convenient. For example, I pay my Tiktok editor who lives in Europe in crypto. I don't need to know any other extra information or his bank account details when it comes to crypto though, even for someone like me, who doesn't absolutely need it at least right now at the moment, I still use it because it's a lot more convenient. I can send crypto though in my boxer on the couch on a Sunday night with no problem. There's value in cryptocurrency. At least certain currencies. There are those that use cryptocurrency in life saving situations, and then there are those who understand there are other people in the world that value that bitcoin there giving bitcoin value, even the people that don't use it themselves. The biggest players are paying attention. Black rack is investing heavily into the crypto industry. They've even invested in bitcoin mining. And right now, since Bitcoin nine crypto is so new, we can expect everyone in the world to find value in it, but we don't need that. All you have to understand is that there are people in this world, that value cryptocurrency. But here's the thing about crypto, even bitcoin, the biggest coin in the market. It's so volatile, how could anyone actually hold it and spend it, but it fluctuates so wild.

Speaker 1: 0:4:41

That's right. It doesn't act like a stable current Even if we're super kind and and, you know, we try to steal man their position. It's still it's there there are wild swings and it's hard to treat something that swings out wildly as as a stable currency because it's not, it's more of an investment than a stable currency.

Speaker 0: 0:4:55

Do you think the the wild swings or because manipulated because people that control fiat currency don't want it to ever be stable. Jamie is a big crypto guy. He knows a lot of shit about those.

Speaker 1: 0:5:6

Alright. Alright. We'll see.

Speaker 0: 0:5:9

Jamie the number one crypto guy in the world. He's

Speaker 3: 0:5:12

I I look at it, but I don't try to speak out of I like I hear things and I believe what people are saying, But also watch, like, it's to me it's it's very speculative. I see problems happening all the time.

Speaker 0: 0:5:23

Yeah.

Speaker 3: 0:5:24

I don't understand why certain things happening. I I googling right now why is... Or can you manipulate bitcoin? People are saying that's the only only reason it's going up right now. But I haven't heard anyone lay out a plan of like this is how they manipulate manipulated it. So there someone.

Speaker 0: 0:5:37

They're saying it's going up because people who hold it or manipulate

Speaker 3: 0:5:40

just just a generic Google

Speaker 2: 0:5:41

though. And I don't know who's saying that. And here's the thing about Crypto or really any small market. They're so small that they can definitely be manipulated. I do believe Crypto and entities are manipulated. Do I know exactly how No, but it's a very small market. So it's very possible. And for something like Bitcoin, really any cryptocurrency to be stable it needs to grow large in market cap. Currently, Bitcoin has a market cap of only four hundred and seventeen billion dollars. This is tiny. Or something like Bitcoin to achieve any kind of stability it needs to grow maybe to a market cap, the size of gold around ten eleven trillion dollars. Now would put bitcoin at around five hundred thousand dollars per coin. But right now, the market is small. It's new. It's speculative and it's highly volatile. But again, for those of you that want to make gains, the best time to enter into an industry is when it's speculative and when it is volatile. And the entire crypto market is just too small that I don't see it not being manipulated anytime in the near future. Even if we look at the precious metal market, which is worth trillions of dollars Jpmorgan paid a nine hundred and twenty million dollar fine for manipulating the precious metals market. Crypto is not a scam. But most cryptocurrencies are a scam. And I'm sure in the future, there will be several cryptocurrencies, several projects that actually do collapse. The one of the projects that I believe will not collapse will be bitcoin and many big players agree more specifically Black and Black has an aggressive plan to take over bitcoin and want to know more about it, go ahead and watch this video right

Speaker 0: 0:7:26
