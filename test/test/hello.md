Hi. You're listening to Stefan La podcast, show about Bitcoin and Austrian economics brought you by Swan Bitcoin. Today, we're exploring whether you should use single signature or multi signature for your bigger h stack. Now, of course, for day to day spending or certain specific scenarios, you may not be thinking about Multi sig here. We're talking more about your h. And my guest today is Ana T from Bit Hive and they're the team behind Hex Wallet. And recently, keeper. The show is brought to you by Swan Bitcoin?

And now onto the show with out. And aren't to welcome back to the show. Hey Steven. Thanks for megan. So there's been a lot going on. I think the conversation around learning to self custody is always an important one. It's always one that's very fresh on my mind as well. And so, you know, we're seeing a lot of discussion and I think recently, of course, there was the news about Luke Dash losing his coins, I think, I I don't know exactly how many, but probably something in the in the range of two hundred bitcoins. So, you know, a serious amount of coin, And so there's been a lot of people making some noise about this statement. Right? They've been saying, oh, look, even if if a bitcoin core developer couldn't secure his coins and what hope does the average person have? Like... They've been saying this kind of narrative. Of course, I disagree with that strongly. But I wonder how how do you think about that. See self custody, I wouldn't like to claim that Ce custody is, you know, the... The easiest things to do. It is a new... A new way to secure your stuff. So it is going to be... There are going be mental hurdles when people are trying to do it. There are going to be bloom things that people have to learn, and it does not come without self responsibility. Right? So no matter how us developers person builder want make it easier. It doesn't come without learning and it doesn't come without surface only. Having said that, and having understood that this is a journey even five years done the line steven we'll be talking about cell custody. And why self custody, or what other things can make Self custody more more secure like there may be a new work proposal or maybe new code people are proposing. So there will always be improvements in self custody. Even the, you know, the the new pneumonia and the seat words that we used, that there was not always there. So what I'm trying to say is that the is a journey there's no perfect self custody solution. And also sub solution is is very personal. Right? So in case of specifically, the you're talking about that is very, very specific and a very, very niche here. So it's not going to It's doesn't really... It is more for fur. It doesn't really apply to, you know, normal users. No one is going to probably have, like, a custom security engine like he had. Right? It's almost it's almost a non issue for regular hot. But, yes, there is an aspect of people start questioning okay. Is there custody solution proper? Is it is it, you know, there is something more then they can do about it and, you know, the whole completion starts again. And this is going to happen again and again. But as you and we know, and what I've understood from that situation. Most of it was... Honestly, it is more preferred because I don't know if there was even a cold storage really were, the way we we term gold storage here gap storage. So there are a lot of moving parts and it is a it is developing story. We don't know how the details of it. So once we know all the details of it, probably, there be some learnings out of it. But we already know that, you know, you shouldn't enroll your own self custody, you shouldn't be doing stuff that is very custom to yourself, and it is not really something which people have used and tried it. It's not tried and interested. So these are a few things which we can already draw out of that incident. So to the whole question around should people self custody, what we end up having is a lot of conversation around what is the best way. Right? We people we see people saying, oh, just, you know, multi signature is too complex. People say things like you should only do single signature with maybe with a past phrase. That seems to be if I had to assess let's say the meta on Bitcoin Twitter or on in online discussion. That seems to be the meta. They say, oh multi league, it's in the too hard basket for most people Obviously, I I disagree agree again. I think it's more like you know, if you're a beginner, you should use maybe a a guided solution like have a professional help you. And intimate, it's an advanced level people you can learn. It's not that like, yes, you know, it's not that hard. That's how I'm seeing it. I'm curious how you see it. Like, single signature or multi signature? See, we... First of all, yes, as you know, Ari is, we have been making the, you know, good bitcoin products for a while and we come from single sig word example wallet is a single solution, it it has all the aspects of a typical solution of whatever all it does. And we can, you know, come to the d of the wallet, which will probably really help some of the listeners. But essentially, we come from that space. So definitely, a very neat solution for people who are just getting started or people who have, you know, you know, small mom. Of money. Obviously, that is subjective. But essentially, you know, not, like life savings, stuff like that. But when it comes to something that you want to hold for long term. Right? You don't wanna hold it for six months and just trade it off. And you want to... You end it this a significant amount of wealth, multi custom multi solution is definitely something you should consider. Okay. Consider it. Understand it. And then probably, you can still take a call that, you know for me single six solution with the hardware wallet and pass. That's that's a fair thing. If you have a if you have if you have a safe or if you have a place where you can keep your hardware wallet and your hundred percent sure is that no one is gonna have or touch it, and your ears are going to automatically if you got it out. Then probably, you know, that might be the solution for you. So my message for for a lot of people who are I talked to. So I talked to a lot of single say people and while building keep over in the last one. You have been talking to a lot. People are interested in. So I do know both sense of the argument. My message for everyone who has significant weld, and one hold it for long term is actually consider it properly and then take a call. And what I have seen is a lot of people who consider Properly, right? And look at a guided solution like a wizard and the way we have built bookkeeper. They actually come to appreciate. Yeah. And so I think what we see is a lot of discussion about the complexity. The added complexity, the backups aspect, the dealing with... Let's say if you're trying to do it you, the right way of the hard the proper way with different hardware devices and so on. I can understand. There's a little bit of extra complexity, but I think my thinking on this is guided more by my friend Michael Fl. I think he's coming from that. He's more of a in the multi sig Maxi camp. And I think his view is like, It gives you fault tolerance. Right? It gives you this extra level of security. You just need to know how to do the backup correctly. And you you have to do certain things in the right way in the basic way that you get these basics right. And then once you get those right, you are just so much more secure. So That's how I'm seeing it. So if you were advising somebody, and let's say this person is now an intermediate or advanced level, you know, they they're not a beginner anymore. They're quite comfortable with their single signature setup. Why should they consider a multi sig in your in your view? See. I think you you... You mentioned it correctly is that the security guarantees of resilience, your tolerance. That multi offers you, you you don't really get that by. Okay. You cannot phrase tool, it adds a little bit of resilience in terms of our attack vector, but it also adds another single point of failure. So it's not really people try to recreate the multi using, you know, a combination of pass phase and single sake and, you know, kind of keeping multiple copies of it. But essentially, the the real the real optional or the resiliency that Monte gives you that those security guarantees, you cannot get with single sale. Right? And some of the things people see when you do single sick, if you really break down single sig, if you d what simply happened in a single sig, then you would realize utilize that actually, single, the attack vectors are the other the places where you can get attacked for a font single actually is the same as multi while in multi you have multiple entities, so you can minimize the trust. Right? Let me try and explain that a little more. So let's take a single set. And d it. So there essentially changes four four key aspects to to the whole system. So the first step really is if there is the user would generate an entropy. Right? That's the first step. The second step is second part of it or the step of it is how how is that backed up? So there's an entropy. It is backed up. Then the third step is from that entropy public and private keys are created. Right? Public keys are used for receiving funds and balance checking and all that, which we typically call wallet functions. And the fourth category is the signing part of it, which is done by private case. Now if you look at these four functions, these four functions can actually be performed by completely separate entities. Okay. Let's take an example. So entropy generation. You can use simple dice road or seed picker or something has to generate the entropy. It doesn't involve any wallet on any hardware device. You can use them it, but that's an... This is an example. Then you could go away and store that entropy in terms of seed words on a metal seed. Right? If you could use a mobile device as a watch only watch only wallet with the text pub. And you could receive funds on that. While you could put, you know, use a seat sign, which is a stateless device, you could put the seed in every time you're signing in. Or using the seed qr and to the signing from that device. So what you see here is that there are four parts to it, which is completely can be handling in different ways. Right? What happens in typical typical wallets is some of these functions or a lot of these functions are combined together. In the simplest case, I would have one app, which just the entropy generation, it does the backup, it does the receiving part and which also signs the term. This the simplest simplest mobile app. The most common what we see is stephen is that other than the backup, all the three functions are combined typical mobile app. So for example, Example, Exam would generate the Entropy, you will store a copy of it separately. And then the receiving of funds and that's a balance has taken and all that word functions. And the signing happens from within the same word. Right? So if you if you see these three... Three... These four functions are combined in different ways, to give rise to different solutions. Right? In all of these situations, the wallet, which is used for signing or which is used for receiving funds. They are the places where, you know, there can be some some, you know, our attacks or there can be some vulnerabilities. For example, if during the receiving part, the wallet might simply you know, obtain the receive address. If you don't check it, then the funds, if I'm receiving funds from you, I show an address that I think is mine, but it is someone else said it's completely gone. Right? So if Our audit it, you know, shows your wrong address and you, you know, send money to that that money is completely gone. Now now let's bring this again. The same four things happen multi. But with four of these you know with the multiple of these keys combined. Now these functions that there are different, like, yeah the example you look of multiple vendors. Like multiple vendors are involved, you could actually by following some simple thumb... Simple thumb rule. You can actually check that receiving address, let's say, two of the entities. And you're so much safer. This is not not a single wallet which can attack and change your receiver address. If you check the receivers of the wallet, and maybe one of the hardware device, it will be really difficult for someone to actually c across those two those two systems and, you know, steal your fronts. So I'm going into the real details of it. But if you really abstract and way back up again, The trust is the... You really can minimize the trust across multiple vendors and multiple locations and multiple platforms. If you use a multi instead of a single cells. Right. And I think that's a really important point to understand. And when we have Multi seek, it just gives us this whole new level of being able to check things. And so for example, we can design things in such a way and I know you know, step on is not as step on of. He is not as, you know, actively contributing in the space nowadays, but, you I think he was popularized this idea, how could I make a wallet or something where even if the coordinator was lying, It could... You know, or how can I set something up where if even one of the devices is lying, I'm still safe? And so in a multi seat context, it gives you that fault tolerance. Right? Because now the coordinating software whether that's, you know, Spectre, desktop, or spa or it's, you know, unchanged capital or it's non junk or it's keeper, which... Whatever that call even if the coordinator app is lying to you, if you're checking that transaction on the device or in the case of receiving. You are checking your receive address on the actual device then you are whole another level safer because it's much harder for somebody to compromise you and steal your coins. And then this becomes very valuable once we're talking about your life savings or even for a corporate context or a fund or a trust or any of these business entities or other legal entities that need that have a very high security requirement. So I think it's such an important thing, but some of the main hurdles, let's say, that for most people. What would you say are some of the main hurdles that people have two using multi sickness like. So I'm sure you've had many conversations with people who are probably doing single sig or just single sig with a past phrase. What kind of excuse do they give you your reason do they tell you, are this is why I don't wanna do Multi sig. Yeah. So like, assuming, there is definitely a learning up. Right? There there is a learning curve when you come to Bitcoin, self custody itself is a learning curve, And within self custody, monte is definitely a a you steeper learning curve than just because there's a lot of education available around, you know, how to back seat. Phrases and how to use a simple wallet. And in this case of single wallet, if you if you just listen to, like, a final thing you would understand. But in case of multi, yes, it is operationally more difficult. Right? You have to ensure more things. It does... But that does give you an order of magnitude better security like we explained It's simply being possible for one key one coordinating app to c you with another hardware manufacturer and maybe one more other hardware manufacturer even somewhere across the globe. To steal just your coin. So it's almost... It's... It is very difficult. It's sort of magnitude difficult. So coming back to the problem to the Huddle is that this is off this operational difficulty is one. Right? And that is why it is very important that this is kind of guided process. Not like you can... You are trying to do it to be the command line, but there's some kind of. Some I'm kind of guide it process it takes you through different steps. Tells you every step. Okay, What does this mean? Maybe do this go into the hardware bullet at this particular place and then then try to extract x or something like that. So if there's a guided process, yes, it will be slightly longer, but it will be handheld in such a way, that multi the operational part of it becomes not that much difficult. So that's one of the excuses or not excuses. That's in... It's a reasonable let's say to be fair to them Right? Not an excuse, Let's say reason. See, well, I I was talking to one of the guys who was in in advertising. He's a very creative guy. His last bitcoin, he loves the idea of it, but he just doesn't have the time to, you know, understand multi beyond. He to get him himself custody he was a few years. To get him on good name probably another few years. Which is... To be again, to be fair to he is busy. He's doing his creative stuff. He's not really doesn't have the time or information to learn about my. So that is a genuine reason, but that's why products that we are you know, the we are building out a lot of people are building nowadays is the cognitive software are actually, you know, it's a kind of assisted multi. So that's one. The second is the cost. The cost is definitely a factor. So if you do a three or five month say, it might be, you know, somewhere around five hundred dollars for you. That's the that's probably a good three or five You... You can probably reduce the cost by trying out some combinations or using some soft software based keys instead of hardware based keys. And if you use some of these keys, It is it is quite okay in terms of security. So there's a cost to it. The costs can come down by, you know, decent convergence plus there there are a lot of people a lot of companies who are trying to build products which are lower cost like Tap sign like Jade. Like, there are few other orders. Right? So the costs are going to come down. So these two sticking out the main hurdles I've heard, and the coordinating software are trying to, you know, do assisted mat, while Hud one manufacturers are trying to reduce the cost. So hopefully, This is going to become easier and easier. Yeah. And, you know, it may it may be a question of as another cycle or two for the multi sig user experience to get better and popularized this further. I'm bullish on this though. I I do believe it'll calm maybe in a cycle or two. Because once you have a lot of people who have a lot of value in in fiat terms, purchasing power terms, it'll just be so much more applicable for them. But I certainly appreciate that today, there there are some operational difficulties? You have to think about, okay, is it more difficult to use these different wallets? Right? As opposed to just having one cold card or one device or whatever you're using. Now you might have to think, okay. I need to know how to use a cold card. And, you know, a seed sign and a a tap signer and a cob or a keystone rather, you know, whatever pick your mix. And not just that, whoever is recovering your coins. Right? Because now we've also got to think about okay, you or me, and aren't you and I could probably figure it out, like, even, you know, but can now wives and kids figure this out? You know. That's like that's like the the other level too. Right? Yeah. I also absolutely would get that. That is where standardization really helps If you if you talk about learning, how to use different hardware wallets or signing devices, then if it is a standard way that those devices work. It is much more easier. Right? To if you learn one of them, properly you can use another one. Same as, you know, using a phone. If you use use one type of phone, There's a good chance that, you, with a little bit of learning, you can use another phone because they have been adopted a lot, and there are some basic basic, you know, assumptions of basic capabilities that were that have been developed. So if there is a... There's more standardization around how these things are used, then definitely it's going to get easier and easier. Right? So we have B standard, we have, you know, the bp. We have we have the more very importantly product descriptors, our product descriptors. And Bs sms and all these good standards which are developing, which is going to make this learning easier because you... If you learn it for one device, you will probably know for another device. So that's that all these things are going together. Yeah. Sure. And so let's talk a little bit about the multi sig setup process. Right? Just so people understand what's going on there. Right? So let's just keep it simple. Right? Let's just say it's a two or three with three different device types and we're coordinating that. What are some of the different steps involved to set up this multi sig and operate that multi sync. Awesome. So let's let's go back to the brief instruction we did earlier. Right? And it is going to be exactly the same. First, there is a step of generating the entropy. In this case, as there are three devices, you will generated it in three different places. This itself is going to give you, you know, no single point of failure. But let's say you have a ledger cold card and let's say jade on a receipt sign. When you initialize those devices, you can use you can use an existing, you know, like the seed phrase you might have. Or you can generate a new one from those devices. You can even add pass there. So now what you've done is, you have three devices who have generated different entropy. Okay. So that piece is done. The entropy be generation was the first piece. Now how do you back it up? You can back it up as a device itself, For example, you know, you just wanna take care of the device and put it in a say. And additionally, furthermore, you can actually put down those seed words in a written format on on steam and keep it somewhere else. So that the backup step is step to taken care of. Now you have three devices ready. And their backup secure the two steps hud. Now what you would do is you would take those choices to an app like keeper, you would create the multi. Right? What what creation of that really step means is is not really created at that point but the path, but you your wallet has the capability of generating the addresses, which can be signed with a script which is a two of three from these three on. So what you would do is you would you would communicate with these three hardware wallets. Either through an F nfc or qr r code and pass on the xbox relevant expo. To the to the coordinating software. Now the coordinating software only has the spouse, which is which are the public key generators, which is the public key generator, It still doesn't have any control of the private key. Yep. So just to be clear, this is like, there's a special menu in some cases. Right? Because it's not necessarily the same as the one that you would use for that device in single signature mode. So for example, in Cold card, you go into settings and you have multi signature export. I think it's in advanced or settings and in there, you go to multi sync export, take that app into a Sd card, put that in, and then the coordinator app has to sort of take all of those three. Right? So so exactly. So I think that's an important step because single can multi from are different standards. So it is good. To, you know, use the right x... Write x expo in the right path. So you would would go into the settings and you would follow the steps to import these three pops from these three devices. Right? And when you do that, you can do that through an Sd card in keeper, you know you can use an Fc c for code card and stuff like that. So that's slightly more secure and operational easier. And it don't really need another computer to get in the middle So that's that's what you would do. Now now your coordinating software has all the necessary pieces to make sure that you can, you know, produce addresses, which which can be signed by that script. So that is the creation part. Now the sending part is let's start with starting. At this point, we also do need to... Once you've created that multi sync, then we need to register the quorum into those devices. Right? So that's the other step where you Now the coordinating software whether spectre or spa or keeper will give you a little piece of information, which again you either use with Sd card or you you do the Qr scan back and forth. And then those devices can now register and understand are, these are the other devices in my multi cx. So let's say, you know, I've got this cold card and I know that, okay, there's a a seed sign in my quorum and a keystone or or whatever other device. And then you have to... Well, theoretically like, if you wanna be really secure. You wanna check. Oh, okay, and you can read on the device. These are the other x pubs associated for this device so you can kind of check everything, make sure it's all, you know, matching up. Yeah. So so I was trying to explain the receipt journey so that it is easier to understand why registration is needed. Right. Right? So absolutely important the registration step. But why it is needed is because how does receive happen is the according software takes these pops completely independently of hardware alerts. And it will show you a particular receiver address. And you would... You... You know one way of doing it. You just send money to that, receiver address and you will have funds if the coordinating software is not trying to be, you know, we're trying to steal their forms. Right? But when you are signing it when you're sending transaction in a, you know, you know, happy case scenario, you would... The coordinating software will build the transaction, right, using using the details that it has. It will construct a p as is something called Ps b, which is partially signed with bitcoin transaction is just a format of how our transaction is represented with original data. And then it communicates again via Nfc or Bluetooth dot Qr code with these hardware devices. Right? Or assigning devices. And they would sign these transactions. Now there are few things which can go wrong here and that's why you correctly mentioned the registration step. Then because the coordinating software has the central role of combining the x part, it has the central role of received, you're the Ps which you know, assigned device would sign, what if the coordinating software is trying to cheat. What if the coordinating software? Is trying to manipulate these things. Though it doesn't have a private keys, but it can manipulate the signing devices to sign the wrong Ps t or, you know, you know, give them the wrong address. So that is where the registration step is super important. And you described it well. Registration basically means the core software is saying, by the way, this is the policy, wallet policy or the or the multi configuration I'm trying to do. Do you want to store those details And at this step, the user would look at the details that is getting stored, they would probably call it cold storage or they would probably call call it, you know, say for what or whatever are they gonna call it. And then they would store that in their signing devices. Now what has happened you have created multiple copies of the same configuration. Right? So next time when signing or receiving happens, coordinating app cannot cheat two independently. You can always have... You all... You still have three other entities that you can check and say, okay, there is something wrong here. So registration is a super important step, which which lets the signing devices independently verify, they're okay, you know, if if coordinating our coordinating app or any of the other sending devices is is trying to cheat or on. So that's that's the essential, you know, fundamental benefit of Yeah. Right. And then so as we're going through and we're checking. So, you know, just we're... Just making sure I'm summarizing everything. So we had our three devices, we've initialized all three of them. We we either brought or did our own entropy or we use the device entropy to create a a twenty four word seat or a twelve word seat, then we ingest the the multi sig x par out of those three into the coordinator. Now the coordinator has the built together policy, let's say, two or three, Now we register the quorum into each of those devices. So now each of those devices knows the other device. And then you, the human should obviously be checking that and making sure are okay, x pub. Okay. It matches to the other x pubs. There's no lying here. There's no, you know, everything matches up. Everything's good. I've got my two or three. Yes. Take that. And now what's next Will now we can receive, let's say, a test a small amount of coin into this wallet and you can check that on multiple devices Right? Because Some of these devices have an address explorer, which is really useful. It's a great feature because now you can you can see it on device one. You can see it on device two and device three or maybe what you do is you would check a quorum of the devices. Right? Maybe if you're running a tool three, you might check it on two of the devices. And then see, okay. On the coordinator, it's also showing me the same address. Okay. Good. Now I can receive some coin into this address. Right? Absolutely. So testing... Even if you, you know, buy a new car, testing it out first us for for a trial learning is always. There's nothing that... It it cannot go wrong. So testing it the way you said is a is a great idea and we recommend it and testing it for sending and leaving and doing, you know, small bits here and there is definitely something user should do before they transfer more of their funds. There are a few checks these that these assigned devices do automatically, For example, the change address, when you're receiving funds there's there is a single single address. But when you're sending funds, there is an address that you sent to, but any of that change because Ut is like a single piece, that when the Ut t breaks, a piece of it comes back to your change address. Now there is a potential with the coordinating as according software, just, you know, manipulate and puts their own change address. So this change address is something that any of the devices which have been registered properly can check automatically. The user doesn't have to manually check it. That's a very neat feature. And a very simple thing because if the change address is incorrect, the the Cs device would simply not sign it. So that's that's a kind of a check under the hood that happens. We call only because there are multiple devices and you register with them. So that's pretty neat. That may not happen in a single same where you're are just using a mobile mobile app and you have just... You have a seed phase, written return down somewhere. So these are the... These are this is an, you know, some of the addition benefits. Yeah. And the reason we mentioned this as well is because there have been some attacks like this disclosed you know, historically. Now I'm not sure if the change one was necessarily used or exploited in the wild, but it was it was there for, some time and then obviously, manufacturers has found it. It got patched up and so on. And so now there's a much... There's a much better awareness and understanding in the industry. And I think the products the software and the hardware are being built with this in mind. Right? So that's that's there that's useful. So what's next in the journey? Let's say. So I think if you want... If you're really paranoid, and if you really want to get to that level this one more step you could do. So what you've done? You have set it up. You have registered it. Check the details. That's like, the theoretical checking of it. Then you've done a practical piece where actually send around funds and you checked where there's those funds are showing up properly or not. This one more step you could do is basically, there are now multiple coordinating software available. Right? We initially, there was only there's only like. That's it. Nothing. So you couldn't really know. Another were others were close source. So you're gonna do much. But with the help of you know, in the... Literally during in the last year, there many more, there's spa, the spectre, there's not, the steeper, what you could do is recreate the wall... Let's say, you've created a two of three in key. You could take the output descriptors, which you can talk about in a little bit. But basically the wallet con... Multi configuration, put it in spa. Right? And check whether it is showing the same addresses, And when you're doing the testing at that time, also you can check the balance from spa and from keeper, you can try to send from spa and check it in keeper, So now what you have you also have a redundancy or not redundancy, is the right word, but multiple places, you can check the coordinating software. Back to the show in a moment. Now as we're talking about multi signature, unchanged can help you with multi signature. This is particularly Important if you are a beginner and you need a guided pathway into multi sig. With unchanged capital, you can create a two of three vault where you hold two keys, and untrained holds the third key. Now they can guide you into this process. They have a concierge onboarding program. You can pay upfront. They will ship you some hardware devices if you need them, and they will do a call with you and walk you through that process and untrained have a really easy platform to use, which is perfect for you if you are a beginner, and you just need some help to guide you through this process. They also have an inheritance checklist which comes as part of the concierge onboarding program. So this can help you in terms of having things like a step by step checklist, letters for the executor or trustee and other things go to unchanged dot com slash concierge to get this. And finally, coin dot com are my favorite producer of hardware signing devices. Most notably, the cold card, but they have a range of products and gear that you will find really handy. With the cold card, obviously, it's it's one of the most popular bitcoin, hardware signing devices, you can use it in single signature or you can use it as part of a multi signature, and it has all these features that really make it easy for you to do that. So you can register the multi signature quorum, you can check the addresses on the device, which gives you some more security. You can initialize the whole thing offline without even connecting to a computer. So this is so many features and it's such a reliable and versatile player that you can use as part of your Bitcoin security setup. So go to coin card dot com. Audio cold cards another gear there. Use code La rivera and you'll get a discount on your cold cards. Now back to the show. Yeah. I guess it's just an extra layer of verification. Right? And certainly these are things that you do when you set up your multi c. Right? And so I think this is a great way for people to give themselves that peace of mind as well because this is one of those things that's really kind of crazy, but it's this idea that the keys can be ported are portable in a way. That you can take the key, like, theoretically, I could have set up that same key in like a a treasure, but then imported into a cold card and it's gonna sign the same way. It's gonna, you know, it's gonna sign the same coins in a way. So that's kind of useful, and that's a step that, you know... People are doing to help verify. Okay, My access to my coins is, you know, or another one that people might do is do a test recovery. Right? Like let me send, you know, thirty dollars into this multi sig and then just practice, oh, I've lost one of the devices or I've lost this other thing, can I recover? You know? How I do I have Do I I have the right pieces together to be able to recover if something goes wrong? And then this can give you that extra peace of mind Oh, okay. I was able to recover. Okay. I'm I'm safe. Right? Exactly. And the best part stefan is that every single user doesn't have to do this. If a lot of users have done it initially or, you know, some users do it regularly, then if any of these pieces, If any one of the coordinating are any one of the hardware devices, do trying to do something funny, they'll be caught. So the incentive to actually trial steal funds when there are a lot of entities involved is actually reduced. So this is the very, very key part. The one of the things in coin we know is the security is also because of the numbers. Right? Because there are so many private keys possible. It's not easy to get them. It is not the same scale, but the idea is if if you have multiple entities, then you can minimize trust in any one of them. You don't need to test a code ending software I can use another one. I I don't need to use a ascending device. I can use another one. Right? So as these things develop, and we have, like, twelve or thirteen saying Us is available now of five, or six coordinate apps available now. So this becomes easier and easier when people get more and more confident about it. There's a lot more talking about it, a lot more education then it goes about it, people who are listening to this podcast broadcast might come back with questions. They might feel slightly more comfortable. So things are converging with standard with the ecosystem and with education. And I'm like you, like, like, your yourself, I'm also very bullish on what. Yeah. Yeah. And so let's talk about spending now. So let's say, I've set up my two or three, and now I wanna send some coins to you anna. So I say, Ar give me an address. I'm gonna pay you, you know, point o one bitcoin or whatever, what steps do I go through? Perfect. So if I give you an address and you have a two of three multi etcetera. The first thing to do is to check that address. I probably have, you know, I'm showing it showing it to you on a screen, or I have, you know, message you that particular address. So when you when you you... When you put that address in your coordinating software, and the coordinating software would probably take, you know, produce a Ps transaction, you would take it to your first hardware device. Right? On that hardware device, the first thing is to make sure that you check whether that's send to addresses correct or not. Right? That's the first step. The like I said, the change address is automatically checked, if that particular device is registered. Right? So these are the two checks that happened during sending if all the device are registered. So all you have to do because they're successfully registered, if you have chosen the right wallet from the from the signing device, then these these are the these are the checks that happen. And I think maybe it's also... So obviously, in this case, it's a two or three, so I'd have to go and let's say I have one device at home and then another another device in a vault or some other location somewhere I have to go to that other location and do a... Get the signature from that device or from that, you know, signing device to get the second signature, bring that back to, you know, the coordinating application So in this case, if it's keeper or Spectre or Spa or whatever. And then once I've ingested that second Ps signature, then it'll say, oh, this transaction is now valid and you can broadcast it. Right? Absolutely. Yeah. You know, we give explain the user's to daily well. So those are the checks that happen at one place but then you take it to another location. The same kind of check you can do there. You can check the receiving address at your in office or any other location we have. Then you put it back to the core software, Not the core software because specific transaction has been signed. And there's no way to for the coordinating app because it doesn't have the private keys to change it. You can let the coordinating app, you know, broadcast the transaction. Right. And I think one other point just on practicality that might be useful for some people. I think I've been because I've been playing around with devices for years. Right? So I think for me, in practice, I have found there are times where Qrs can be difficult. Right? So because the Qr flow, like, as an example, if your... It depends on the device you're using, sometimes the resolution is or the the camera on the other device bad. And so one tip that I found useful is if you can have the qr scanning device, that could be maybe your home device. And then if you've got like one that's in a vault as an example. And you might have a mix. Right? You might have a mix in your quorum. And so then the devices in the vault maybe they can be a little bit easier to have a micro sd for signing because they are a little, I think it depends on the flow Right? It depends on the coordinating app and everything. But if you just have a micro sd card you're just going into the vault area or into an office or somewhere, then maybe it's a little easier to kind of get the signature done. Because if you're kind of out in a remote location and you're trying to scan this the Qr and the signature is not working and you know, things like this where, you know, it's... It can be a bit difficult. Right? So I think in that case, it might be a little easier. Now, of course, there is Nfc is also there's Nfc devices. Things like, you know, the the Tap sign is an example. But I guess there is one downside with devices like the Tap sign is you're getting less Yeah. Because it's... You can't check the addresses on this thing. You can't... There's less that you can check about the transaction. So you know, there's there's trade offs with all of these things, it is a cheaper device. But, I guess if you're storing serious serious money, well, then maybe you're going for the device, the the bigger devices with the screen and with a keypad and things like this. So those are a few tips, I guess that I would just offer for listeners as well when you're thinking about if you're crafting your and Multi sig. Yeah. Okay. So let's talk a little bit about the backups and the output des distributor and Bs. Can you decipher a little bit of this at least current state of play as we talk, you know, today is the thirty first of January twenty twenty three. What's the current state of play with Multi league and backups. See one things you might want because you just on very important point. When you are keeping something in the same, and you wanna use Sd card versus Qr code. One of things people forget is some of these devices used to not have a battery. Right? So what you don't want to do is actually get that device back into your home and then do this stuff and then take it back. Right? So if you have it in a safe, it is not a bad idea, either that... In most of the new devices, that's why they have some kind of battery, the new ledger, the j, they have battery, Or if you have, like cold card that requires a battery, this this not a battery idea you just carry the battery with you. So carry the battery and as z gets card with you. You know, just do the piece there either through code or Sd card and then come back. Do not carry the sign. You don't have to carry the signing device back. You, you can keep it back it. Right. Yes. So just to explain there. So the idea here is, let's say we've got a two or three multi sig and just storing, like a big amount of coin on this or whatever. The whole point is to not have to have, like, okay. Yes. At the start, when you set up that quorum, yes, all three devices can be in the same location because you haven't put any coins on there. But once you put coins on, then you don't wanna bring them back together because theoretically you're vulnerable at that point. Right? Like, if a criminal or a someone comes to you know, try to attack you at that point, you're vulnerable. Yes. Even at creation actually because the Is between monte works is not really track that Way? You can actually not have them at the same location at any point of time. Right Yeah. Of course. Right. So you location you can do once one important, you know, also it's one important home back. I mean, I was just saying more from a practicality because you might wanna Let's say you wanna set it up and then test recovery, test with small amounts before you separate the devices and put them into, you know, different locations. One in the mountain, one in the, you know, one in the vault one in the office one in, you know, somewhere. So I think that's probably where I was saying that just from a practicality point of view. But then once they once you put the coins on there, like Siri coin on there, then you don't wanna pull them together because now, you know, that's where the risk is. So anyway, we spoken about that. Let's get back to the backups question. So, you know, typically, this means you save a Pdf for an output des distributor or Bs. He What's the current state of play there? Yeah. So so why why do we need these these output descriptors or word configuration is because even if you have two of the three keys, you cannot recover your funds. Right? I just wanna repeat that. In a multi, if you... Let's say in a three or five multi, It doesn't mean that if you have three of the five keys, you can completely... You can not... Cannot even recover any of your funds. The reason being is that, okay. You have the three keys to the safe. Let's imagine all of the safe. Right? So you have three keys, of the safe and you can open the safe, But how do you find that safe. Right? How do you get to that safe? That is the map you know, in that terms is what the word configuration is. And that word configuration of the multi configuration file contains the map details or it basically contains the other public details of the other key that you would need to need to unlock your funds based. Or get access to. Just just to want to be clear why multi configuration files so important. Now that is where things like output des descriptors and, you know, Sms and all these things come through. So output disrupt is is it's a very neat. Standard takes care of all the different aspects of what configuration means. Configuration doesn't just mean the export also means the path, and the script type that you're using and stop them. Right? So that is what forms the output in a simple since I'm not getting into time log and multi yet, but that's an output description. And if you have the output description. And if you have the minimum number of keys, you can definitely access the phones. If you have three keys after five, and you have the multi configuration file or output disrupt, you do not need the other two keys. That's the importance of it. Output descriptors a format, which a lot of wallets use. Now there... Like I said there are multiple pieces in there. Like the expert, the path, the master fingerprint, the script type. So these are the part of opera output written. I would say an improvement to that is the Bs sms, which is Bitcoin secure multi setup. I think. But Bs essentially has the output descriptors given a specific output with template. But it also some other details. One very neat detail that Bs has is actually, it has the first address of the man. Right? I I really like this part and why that is important. So let's imagine you have these five devices. One of the option after registrations, because is you go away and check all these five devices for all the experts, all the parts and all the duration in this and that. Right? That's one way are doing it. But alternatively, what you could do is you could... If it's a normal multi, you can just check the first address. Right? Because the first address is a der deviation of all these components. So the first address is correct, is it... It's matching across the five devices, then there is no way they could have changed one of the xbox or they could have changed one of the paths because they will not get the first receiving at this. So by checking one piece, you have... You have actually checked multiple of these multiple of these items. Right? As you are mentioning, the Bs sms as the first address. And so you're were saying that basically, because the first address is going... It has to be the same, then it's, I guess you're saying that's the reason why you find it useful as a wallet developer when you're coding or making and building this. Right? Even from a user point of view, instead of checking for, like, five different things do. They have to check all the c experts. So they'll have to check five pops, plus they'll have to check the five division parts Plus then update set the five script types. Because because any of this going wrong, will mean that it's a completely different world. So if instead of that, what you could do in a simple case, there are complex case where it doesn't apply. But in a simple case, what that means if you you check the first address, you essentially have checked all the input parameters to the first. So if I check this one address across the five device, I know it is the right registration. So these are the kind of, you know, improvement that are happening from a standard point of view. And that is why I said, you know, standards are a leading towards a better Ux in the multi space. I see. Yeah. Okay. And so let's talk a little bit keep then specifically, let's talk a little bit about some of the... Oh sorry, one other thing. So with this whole output des script Bs. I guess, the important point just for people to remember is that you can keep multiple backups of this. Now, yes, it impacts your privacy, but it'll... It it'll it helps your redundancy and your your ability to recover if something goes wrong. So this piece, this output des script, the Bs, the wallet configuration file, whatever it's called, make sure you have multiple backups of that. You might even think about having a copy of that with your lawyer or someone who you're doing inheritance planning with, because it'll be essential as part of the recovery process there. So that's just something to keep in mind. One one thing you could move with those files is which is very practical list. If you have the signed devices, let's say, in a safe, you can keep a copy there. If you have, like, three devices in three safe in three different location, just keep one copy with each of them. So even if you... Yeah. Get a Usb, put one... Yeah. Or you can just, like, have it in a, you know, in a Ed or something. So that's a that's a very practical way of doing it. What some of the hud wallets also doing this stephen is when you are registering, This is very neat. When you're registering, you're actually giving those details with the harder vulnerable. Example cold coal card lets you export that back. So now I don't need to store another copy of the word configuration with a cold card if it's in a safe. I can use the same word configuration from Cold card to, you know, get that back. So, you know, things are becoming much easier, you gonna to team up listen. Right. Yeah. So it's it's even more redundancy then. So let's talk a little bit about the inheritance stuff. Because I know this is something you are looking at for keeper as well. So what's the plan there? So so innate is the way we... In looked in different ways. Right? A lot of, you know, they've extreme bitcoin might say, okay. I don't care about the legal aspects of it. And I just wanna make sure my clients are safe, and I can pass it on. Some even believe that they just wanna dive with their coins and just donate need it to the network. I'm not of the opinion. I wanna plan in for generations, and I I a lot of people want to do it that way. Once you have a future generation that you can look at, you would going to pass that well done. For for general reasons. So when you bring is planning, there are two aspects to it. One is obviously, that access to the keys, And then the second is the right to have the keys. Right? When it is about the right, it is the legal construct of a jurisdiction, that you have the right to hold the keys. A lot of time, this aspect of the legal title or the rights to have the keys is missed out. Right? What we wanna do with keeper is try to we want look at both these aspects and assist in both these things. Okay. If you... You know, if... Let's say your partner is is going to get the coins of... If if something happens to you, and you have told them all the locations where, you know, two of your in three of your device are. Then probably, you know, it's the access part of is easy. But there is no reason that, you know, someone else after you are not there, can claim. That okay. That person has access to it, but actually that person is not the rightful for owner, then they would be in a mix, and you don't want to get the, you, let them have get into that kind of situation. So that is why, you know, having your legal title clear it's very easy. It's not very complicated. Is a very important way to secure thing and make it easy for loved ones that they don't have to get into hassle of us, figuring out where the keys are, and then also trying to prove that why, you know, those keys belong to that. You're the rightful owner or air of those kind. Tracking. So these are the two hours specs. What keeper does is... Obviously, it tells you what are the safeguard card tips like we talked about using a battery using the Sd card of how to secure your keys. And not just for yourself, you might remember the pin, but what about if someone else your your you're know your kids are trying to access... With would they know the pin. So it gives you a loss, You've got tips of how to secure your keys not just for yourself even for future generations. And that's the access part of it. It also helps you identify those that to wall... That particular wallet or the multi wallet. In a very unique way so that you can, you, put a simple, you know, part of your will, get okay, you know, I have funds in this particular multi, and this is how we identify this multi. And anyone... You know, this person x y z is actually the rightful owner of them. How I get... How do they get access can... Doesn't have to be put in the wheel at all, so that, you know, the or if you don't want rush a lawyer or the guy who is writing the wheel. You don't have to put the access part there at all. But you do have to put how how you can uniquely identify those things and how that particular fund belongs to the air. Yeah. And I mean, there's all these privacy concerns aspects of a too because there are people who might say I don't wanna disclose, you know, how many coins I have or whatever. So some of that is gonna be a little bit. You have to find a way. So we have actually... Here we have been actually... We think we we have found a way, and we've been talking to a lot of lawyers and a lot of people in this space, how this makes sense and we've got we've got great feedback on that. So what you put in the put in the doesn't have to it doesn't have to be the experts. You don't really need to put the experts. You can put your master fingerprint there, You can put some other details there, which doesn't leak privacy at all. Right? So there are some other ways of establishing the uniqueness, Basically, what you want do at the end of it is in the will, if there's an air because uniquely identified that this is the air. This is their legal name. This is where the labor those kind of details. And you have uniquely identified as best as possible uniquely identified which funds then essentially, you can, you know, that's that's all that will need. So using using other methods or the you know, rather than putting export is is, you know, way to get across that prioritization. Gotcha. Yeah. And certainly, as I mentioned for, like, some people might be comfortable with maybe giving a, like, an output to a lawyer, but other people very much not. But of course, people should just listen should be aware there is a privacy consequence to that. So obviously, you think that's through some people, they're not comfortable with that and they would rather, you know, keep that away from the lawyer or away from those other locations and maybe that output descriptors is only backed up in a location that your. Lee and see it something like that. But you just have to also consider the trade off of redundancy. Right? The more copies of that out there, the more redundancy and the easier it is for somebody to help recover in the case of that output to script information somehow being lost. Right? Because it's possible and we'd hate for people to lose access to the coins. Right? Those are probably a few important points. Also, I guess there's some of the more advanced stuff that's coming. Right? So I did an episode recently about mini script there's been some discussion about music two. Do you see applications for any of this stuff? Or is it maybe a bit early? It is definitely a bit early, but we are keeping close look at it and we are very excited with mini script and Music to frost and stuff. It is definitely early because as you would appreciate there are there are situations not situations there are still cases, a in terms of when you're using a music two or you have interactivity involved there. Which is not really the best thing when it comes to security room want to really either bring the keys together or go to them multiple times. Right? Neither do you want to make them interact with each other. So there are there are some months or problems in that space, but you know a lot of amazing people are working towards it. So that will probably get lot sooner or later. Manuscript script has been, you know, actually, manuscript script has been around for a while now. Right? And people often ask us, so to why not many script yet, Why not manuscript script yet. We have looked at manuscript script we have played at. But The practical aspect of it is different as that mini script essentially generates a safe bitcoin. Right? Mini script is good and generate a same bitcoin strip. However, other than multi, the safe bitcoin swimsuit generates with multiple spending conditions and multiple branches and all that. Is really... It doesn't really have that much of an importance is when it's a simple multi. That can be done without with a simple script. But when it comes to multiple spending policies, that is when really, like a like, a two of three plus two of one of two plus law or, you know, some kind of a combination. That is when manuscript script really comes to the fore. Now, though that right now, but really, there three problems to it because tap is still not, you know, tap or music is still not there out there. So so you wouldn't really be able to benefit that much more minister right now as you would once these things are in place. So strip can be used, but it is not effective without these other factors. Right? So once these factors are there, and then there... There's less interactivity and the harder wallets are, you know, able to showcase those policies on the small screen. These are un unsolved problems yet. That is when script will really be useful. So we are looking forward to those kind of developments in the ecosystem. To be able to use these advanced features. Yeah. Any thoughts on time locks as well because this is something where, you know, people love to... I guess, it's one of those areas where people love to or talk about, you know, this and that. And now Bitcoin does have time locking. Like, on chain time locking. But I think practical uses of that outside of, let's say, the smart contracting stuff like lightning, which is a different, you know, kettle efficient. But in terms of multi sig and stuff like that, these... Are you seeing much interest in this or much practical use Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. There are a lot of people interested in time There have been people okay. Are you going to do time. Are you gonna do time lock Is absolutely time lock is something which we have done internally. But the time lock and you know, we spoke about the registration and how you verify the details and all that. That particular piece is still not there for dialogues. So you can implement time logs, but you would we may not have a particular signing device supporting it. Not ledger is working towards it and we are working with ledger to see how we can implement it. But essentially, at this point in time, there is no real hardware support for time locks. Right? So you might have... I think again, from your podcast and otherwise, we know that I think Is trying to use time locks. But there is no signed device support for it. And even if there is a signing device support, it will be without registration. So you're losing out onto to some security to have some security. What we are trying to get two towards with script and all is trying to get to situation where you don't have to do security too much to gain time block as a feature. Yeah. Totally fair. I mean, the security... The whole reason why we're using multi seek to begin with is the security benefits. So obviously, we're not gonna, you know, throw that out the window. So, yeah, I think that's important. So I guess couple tips that maybe we should leave listeners with, just make sure when you're doing your multi sig, you keep it simple. Right? Like, don't do something crazy. Don't don't so to stay in the World T pathways. I think there are good reasons to use the typical, like two or three or three or five. I think for most people, unless you have a specific use case, I think for most people, two or three or three or five, it's probably gonna be a good quorum people making sure you keep those backups as we mentioned, the backup of the output des script or the Bs. I think those are important points to remember. But, yeah, I guess, you have any other kind of tips on multi sig before we finish that? Well, I think it's just a a quick Tl l on what we discuss. Like, okay. There are these three you know, these two good configurations available and a lot of software wallets like keeper offer that. So stick to that stick to that. You take backups, test it out, like we said, test it out on multiple hardware the hardware devices, any devices and also test it for probably on multiple coordinating software, like spa and keeper and spectral wallet. And when you do that, you will be so comfortable because you're seeing three different things staying exactly the same same balance in the same output. So it be like, yeah. You know, what I I kind of trust this this situation of the system that are built. So if you do these three these few things, then, you know, Monte sig is launch. So I think I think it's worthwhile for a lot of people, now certainly not for the beginners, but I think for people who are, let's say you're a long time bitcoin and, you know, you your stack is worth a reasonable amount. It's worth your while. Right? Like, I think people lose perspectives sometimes, right? Because they might be like someone who, you know, maybe bought some coins a few years ago or whatever and the prices run up and now they've got, like, you know, over a million dollars worth of coin or let's say, over twenty, twenty five coins, like, a single signature hardware wallet or hardware signing device or hardware designer. And, you know, maybe it's time for you to think, hey. If you if you're holding you know, over twenty or twenty five coins worth, what's like a few hardware devices and some metal seeds. That's nothing for you. Right? Like so it's it's important to think about the perspective. Yeah. Sorry. Just on that we did some, you know, back then low calculation. But like I said, typical monte today cost five hundred. Right? And let's say, even if you have bitcoins worth five thousand dollars, which is probably, you know, a quarter a bit bitcoin a point to bit bitcoin depending on the price. That that will be, you know, something around five percent to ten percent of the security cost. Now in in Bitcoin, you know that it can ten x very easily. And if it does ten x, then it will become, like, one percent of your one percent of your cost. Having a security cost of one percent to secure the whole amount is a decent security cost. Right? So if you think about it in those terms and, you know, put in some hours of effort, actually, like, you know, you have orders of magnitude better security and the cost is not really It is one percent of the total amount potential. So that's that's probably one way to think about it. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So I think that's a multi si aspect. Let's talk a little bit about Bitcoin for India. So I unfortunately could make it last year because of clashes and stuff, but I'm I'm looking forward to being there. Off the top of my head is October fourteenth and fifteenth. I think, yeah. Do you wanna just give us an update on big conference. Yeah. Absolutely. So this is this is the community piece that some of us are involved in with other volunteers, but more than happy to you know, put it on this platform as well that, you know, Stephen will be person there. And there be many other bitcoin who would be there who would be, you know, talking to p in India and talking multi say, talking past is trucking a lot of stuff, you know, how to do how to do probably running a node. So it will be a mixed conference like like, was this time there the technical track and there will be a main track. But we are we are very excited about it and we are obviously going to look for more more participation this time from speakers and from audience. So if is in October fourteen, fifteenth is the date as of now. Fantastic. And in Bangalore. Right? And so I... I'm also... You know, it's been one year now. Like Bitcoin, it will it will have been... You've already had the first conference. You've been growing this meetup up network, let's say, of more committed bitcoin, And so hopefully, there'll be a a a, you know, a growth in the community by then and who knows maybe there'll be a lot of people joining the community between now and then so maybe that will be there as well. So looking forward to that. And, yeah. Any any other points you wanted to mention before we finish up? No. I think I think by the time, this probably the the bot goes out, the keeper app would be available on mean net. Till not was on test net. It is still beta, but it is available maintenance, so it's very easy for people to test out. So do give it a run try it out with small amounts of one amounts of Sat. And give us some feedback. It is an awesome product and we hope loved. Fantastic. Okay. Anna, thanks for joining me. Thanks, Steven. That's for Me again. Cheers. I hope you found that discussion helpful and make sure to share this episode with any family or friends who are curious about setting up multi signature and bitcoin security. It's been a while since so we've really walked through some of the details of this. Of course, I have those earlier ear episodes with a range of people talking about these things. I will include those in the show notes also, But I think this one is a good overview episode for people who wanna understand where things are at today with multi signature. So share the episode and the show notes are available at stefan la rivera dot com slash four five five. Thanks for listening. And I'll see you in this citadel.
